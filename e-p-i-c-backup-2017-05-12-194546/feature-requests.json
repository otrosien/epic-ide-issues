  "description": "I guess you could save people lots of time if your home \r\nand/or download page would clearly state in a single, \r\nprominent place that \"Epic 0.3.0 requires Eclipse 3.0 or \r\nhigher, which in turn requires Java 1.4.2 or higher, and \r\nthe debugger plug-in that comes with Epic 0.3.0 requires \r\nPerl 5.6 or higher.\"\r\n\r\nYour home page did say that Eclipse 2.1 was no longer \r\nsupported, and I eventually found a reference to the \r\nPerl version required by the debugger plug-in in the \r\nUser's Guide \\(unfortunately only after I had succeeded in \r\ngetting the debugger plug-in to run by guessing that the \r\nPerl version m imight be the problem, and trying whether \r\na different one might help\\), but why is the information \r\non required software versions strewn all over the place?\r\n\r\nI had to search Google Groups to find out that Eclipse \r\n3.0 required Java 1.4.2 or higher \\(and that after I had \r\nmade it a point to use Java 1.3.1 as a special favor for \r\nEpic, as a previous Epic version came with a warning \r\nthat I shouldn't use Java versions newer than 1.3 on \r\nSolaris because they are somehow broken\\!\\), and I \r\nfigured out the Perl version issue by trial and error \r\n\\(because none of the error messages I got gave any \r\nhint that the errors might be due to the Java or Perl \r\nversion used\\).  My org.epic.updatesite and Eclipse-SDK \r\ndownloads are timestamped between 1:45pm and 2pm \r\nlocal time, now it finally works, it's 6pm local time and I \r\ndon't think I did much of anything else in the meantime, \r\nso it took me about 4 hours to get my Epic update to \r\nrun\\!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I did look on your home and download page for \r\nsoftware requirements, but there didn't seem to be \r\nanything beyond the required version of Eclipse.\r\n\r\nBy the way, as it turned out that the Perl version was \r\nthe problem with the debugger plug-in, maybe I could \r\neven have gotten the debugger plug-in in my previous \r\nversion of Epic \\(0.1.0 with debugger plug-in 0.0.7\\) to \r\nwork by installing an appropriate version of Perl, so there \r\nmight have been no need for me to update my copy of \r\nEpic from 0.1.0 to 0.3.0 in the first place.  I had simply \r\ngiven up on the debugger plug-in of Epic 0.1.0 and \r\nassumed that it didn't quite work yet.",

I suppose that some simple heuristics could be used to find the likely base classes, but it will never be reliable due to the kinds of run-time hocus pocus you can do in Perl combined with the lack of static type information. Similarly, showing a list of methods for an object requires type information not available in Perl 5.

I can upload that here once I get it cleaned up.\r\n\r\nOne element that I was wondering about is if there are any plans to expand/extend org.epic.core.model.SourceFile and the parser. Currently when I create a new module thru my wizard, I write out a temp module based on Module::Starter and then do some basic Regex substitutions. I'd like to have it more OO and use the SourceFile object model, but would need to add items to it. For example, the ModuleUses class would need to list the imports in addition to the name, and there would need to be setters as well as the getters. Is there a long term plan to expand the parser, or to leave it \"good enough\" to generate the outline view?\r\n\r\nThanks, Jim\r\n",

Generally, I think that relying on the parser and making SourceFile smarter would be a better and more reliable solution than depending on regexps. If you wish to expand the code, you are free to do so. If you submit patches and I will test/review them as time permits. Any changes to perl.g are especially sensitive and must be checked before releases. The 'syntax.pl' test case is used for this purpose. After bigger modifications I also run the parser over my Perl installation as a smoke test.",

This then causes me to have to sit and wait for \r\nthe timer to expire after entering a block of code when I \r\nreally do want the checker to kick in. With the proposed \r\nmethod, the idle timer could be set down to just 1 or 2 \r\nseconds so that each time the programmer paused, the \r\nsyntax checker would do a quick check thus eliminating \r\na waiting period as is now required.\r\n\r\nThis would also increase speed and keystroke \r\nrecognition in the editor as the syntax checker wouldn't \r\nbe jumping in during code entry. \r\n",

However, I'm wondering if the source folders and add\r\nperl library folders could be handled a different way.\r\n\r\nI've attached some screen shots to show what I mean.\r\n\r\nIn \"source folders.GIF\", I have a screenshot of how you add\r\njava source folders to the build path of a java project in\r\nEclipse.  In \"classpath.GIF\", I have a screenshot of how\r\njars files, class folders, and other java libraries are\r\nadded to the classpath of a java project in Eclipse.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is mimicing this functionality for Perl\r\nsource and module directories.  You may not even have to\r\nmimic the functionality at all.  You may be able to use the\r\nalready existing functionality and just adapt it to the Perl\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\nIE.  Instead of choosing the addition Perl library\r\ndirectories for the entire project as static classes, we\r\ncould add \"class folders\" which would then be passed to the\r\nPerl Interpretter as \"-I\" parameters.  This way the user can\r\nspecify relative directories which are already apart of the\r\nproject, instead of having to specify absolute pathnames in\r\nthe project preferences and have to search the hard drive\r\nfind the project directory.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I didn't explain further earlier.\r\n\r\nI would also like to add, I really like the plugin and I use\r\nit without any problems \\(almost\\) everyday.  However, I just\r\nthink this would be a nice addition.  If it's too much work,\r\nthen don't worry about it.  :\\)  I'm not very familiar with\r\nEclipse's plugin architecture, or else I would go into more\r\ndetail.",

However, a \r\ncloser inspection of the current EPIC code reveals some \r\nflaws in how the global action handlers are currently mapped \r\nto the editor-specific action instances. Specifically, the \r\nmethod PerlEditorAction.setActiveEditor is never invoked, \r\nnor is the default constructor \\(both of which came as \r\nsurprises to me\\). So the immediate problem which surfaces \r\nduring an attempt to incorporate the \r\nToggleMarkOccurrencesAction into the current design is that \r\nit is given no opportunity to initialize its enabled/\r\ndisabled status.\r\n\r\nI can also see how your action differs from all the other \r\neditor actions implemented so far. Unlike them, it has no \r\nties to an editor instance. The visibility only depends on \r\nthe editor type. Apart from that, the action simply \r\nmanipulates a global preference, and all open editors must \r\nreact to its change. It would not make much sense to keep a \r\nseparate instance of ToggleMarkOccurrencesAction in each \r\neditor, while it seems quite natural for the other actions. \r\nBTW, for the same reason your method PerlEditor.\r\nisMarkOccurrence also appears out-of-place \\(apart from the \r\nsomewhat unfortunate name\\).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am going to look into your patch again after some \r\nrethinking and corrections to the actions code.",

        "text": "Logged In: YES \nuser\\_id=86907\n\nHere is what I found out so far:\r\n1\\. One action instance per editor \\(instantiated in \r\ncreateActions\\) is good for those actions that read/change \r\nstate of a single editor. All current PerlEditorActions \r\nbelong to this category.\r\n2\\. By this definition, your ToggleMarkOccurrencesAction is \r\nnot a PerlEditorAction. Even if one opens 5 editors, there \r\nshould still be just 1 instance of this action. Note that \r\nthis action does not need to update itself when the active \r\neditor changes. The action does not keep editor-specific \r\nstate. It only needs to initialize its 'checked' property \r\nonce, before it becomes visible. This can happen when the \r\naction is created.\r\n3\\. PerlActionContributor is created by Eclipse once for the \r\nentire plug-in, not once for each editor. So it makes \r\nperfect sense to let it own an instance of \r\nToggleMarkOccurrencesAction there \\(as you did\\).\r\n4\\. For each action specified in the plug-in manifest, \r\nEclipse creates a RetargetAction instance behind the scenes. \r\nEach such RetargetAction listens to editor activations. \r\nWhenever an editor becomes active, PerlActionContributor is \r\nfirst given an opportunity to associate action IDs with \r\naction instances \\(kept in the activated editor, or \r\nelsewhere\\). PAC creates the associations by invoking bars.\r\nsetGlobalActionHandler\\(id, action\\). In turn, the above \r\nmentioned RetargetActions bind themselves to the \r\ncorresponding actions, which they retrieve by calling bars.\r\ngetGlobalActionHandler\\(id\\).\r\n\r\nRegarding your extra question: yes, I think I am the only \r\none working on EPIC code right now \\(also committing \r\nimprovements programmed by my assistant - for example, the \r\nMark Occurrences feature is hers\\).",

Please avoid writing code which permits silent failures. \r\nWhen in doubt whether a reference can or cannot be null at \r\nsome point, make a best effort to figure it out from the \r\ndocumentation and/or by analyzing the possible control and \r\ndata flows. Use assertions to clarify your assumptions. \r\nStatements like \"if \\(obj == null\\) return;\" are generally a \r\nbad idea. It is preferable for bug activations to result in \r\nexceptions rather than in suppressed behaviour. If you know \r\nthat the reference may be null for a legitimate reason, \r\nplease comment why.\r\n2\\. Avoid filler \"documentation\" \\(i.e., generated comments, \r\nsuch as \"Creates an XYZ object.\" for an XYZ constructor\\). In \r\nother words, don't repeat yourself.\r\n3\\. Please capitalize the first letter in javadocs. It seems \r\nthat everyone else does.\r\n4\\. Please use third-person descriptions in javadocs \\(\"Does \r\nthis and that\" rather than \"Do this and that\"\\). Both Java \r\nand Eclipse documentation use this convention.",

  "summary": "Incremental retrieval of variables in debugger",
  "description": "Up to and including version 0.6.0, EPIC retrieves values of ALL variables in a single request on each suspend event. This kills performance when working with complex data structures. Moreover, a single variable with a \"large\" value \\(e.g. several hundred kilobytes\\) is enough to make the debugger unusable. The format in which variables are exchanged between EPIC and Perl is quite cryptic, with the core module dumpvar\\_epic.pm being a hunk of uncommented code apparently borrowed from another project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this feature request is to implement incremental \\(lazy\\) retrieval of variable values as they become requested by the user expanding items in the Variables view. By the way, the exchange format for variables should be specified and improved to be easier to extend and work with when debugging the EPIC debugger.",

First I would love to have Perl::Critic run everytime I save my file, not only each time I run \r\nSource&gt;Perl::Critic. This helps me find coding problems right away. It should be an option to turn on and off.\r\n\r\nSecondly there is no possibility to add program arguments to the Perl::Critic commandline. At work we have some specific profiles, that I would like to attach using -profile &lt;PATH\\_TO\\_CRICITPROFILE&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Everytime I hear about a new \"exciting\" language I sigh, as it practically means more learning and tooling efforts to achieve the same thing as before - and as always these new languages integrate poorly with others (interfacing with C libs being one notable exception).\r\n\r\nBut needless to say, new generations of programmers will most probably \"discover\" and therefore prefer to work using those new languages. And of course, the better tools there are, the more likely this \"progress\" will happen. So if you can propose a migration path that would enable EPIC to also claim \"support\" for Perl 6 (grammar? other features?), it's would certainly be a good first step.\r\n\r\nNot being familiar with Perl 6, I cannot really judge whether it is different to the point of making reuse of EPIC infeasible and starting from scratch (on top of Eclipse DLTK?) a better option, but given that it's kept the brand name \"Perl\", it's only natural for new users familiar with Eclipse/Perl to assume the brand name \"EPIC\" to handle it somehow.",

To start with, I have created an addition to the existing emacs perl6-mode.el which adds an index of variables, classes, subroutines, and methods.  Fundamentally, without trying to start by identifying all the MANY key words, a mod to the existing Perl IDE ought to be fairly easy but maybe not: I know nothing about EPIC (except a brief look many years ago), but maybe I could help a bit.  I certainly have the motivation because I am mostly working in Perl 6 these days and want an IDE (emacs is too foreign for me because of the lisp it is based on, vi is plain unnatural, atom is still in development and plugins are too scattered at the moment, Komodo does not plan any Perl 6 support anytime soon, and I've found no other commercial editor with plans for Perl 6 support, either).",

  "description": "When using the Perl CGI interactive debugger, is there an equivalent to the Apache HTTP error.log?  The debugger acts as its own webserver but when a program has a fatal error (that goes to STDERR I assume) the message can't be seen as it would in httpds error.log.  I understand it's using the Brazil http stack but was unable to find a properties file that might say where errrors are logged to.  Is this something that exists, or could be added/exposed please?",

The \"new\" project has not only Perl code but also folders with data, csv files, properties file etc.\r\nSo when I \"finish\" creation, the project shows in Navigator as expected with the structure already on the filesystem.\r\nThe problem is that Epic will go rampant into each of those directories/folders trying to validate everything as Perl code, which obviously it should not attempt. Unless I am missing some checkbox, I'd like to have on to check or right-click on a folder or file and have a \"Add to Epic ignore list\" \\(put Epic in there to make it distinct from SVN\\)\r\nThe drawback of of not having this feature is that the Error log gets poluted with hundreds of errors from the other files making it impossible to sift anf find the actual errors.\r\n",

  "description": "Would it be possible to syntax color variable references in double quotes? I'm currently working on a project that involves bash script generation, and this would help me ensure that I am properly escaping bash variable references, while not escaping perl variable references \\(granted, EPIC will tell me if compilation fails because I am using an undefined variable, but the visual confirmation is still very useful\\).\r\n\r\nvim currently does this, although it messes up on hash/object/array references \\(e.g. in the examples \"$foo-&gt;\\{bar\\}\", \"$foo\\{bar\\}\", \"$foo-&gt;bar\\(\\)\", and \"$foo\\[0\\]\", vim will highlight $foo as a variable, but will leave the rest of the characters highlighted as a string\\). It would be ideal if EPIC would highlight both parts properly.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\\!",

        "text": "Logged In: YES \nuser\\_id=86907\nOriginator: NO\n\nI took a closer look at wscite today. I think that your RFE concerning custom background colors for lexical elements in syntax highlighting preferences should not be implemented for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1\\. The background color already has a defined function in Eclipse, namely for showing annotations. Annotations mark areas of text to signify their relevance in some \\(usually temporary\\) context. For example, the highlights provided by the \"Mark Occurrences\" feature and the highlights provided by the syntax checker are both annotations. The user may configure annotations to use background color or \"squiggles\" \\(underlined text\\). Another occassion where the background color plays a role is the Compare function, where incoming and outgoing changes are colored differently.\r\n\r\n2\\. JDT \\(the Java IDE\\) does not support your proposed option, and I suppose this was a conscious design choice.\r\n\r\n3\\. While one could still argue that giving the user and option to chose their background color isn't wrong because you do not have to use it, this claim conflicts with the general principle of keeping the GUI as simple and consistent \\(across Eclipse plugins\\) as possible.",
